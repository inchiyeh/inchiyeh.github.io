title: Data set!

Another challenge that we expected to meet along the way is the challenge or rather the super challenge of the Data set. Datasets are a collection of data that are used in the machine learning process. Each sample in the dataset is independent from other samples and the columns of the dataset show special characteristics. Data sets really play an important role in the discussion of machine learning and the development of intelligent systems. Actually, the machine learns what the data gives it.

What we are going to achieve is an intelligent model for classifying images. The machine takes an image from the user and outputs the classes to which this image belongs. For example, if a picture of a Duck is given to the model, it should be able to identify that the picture is an Animal, a Bird, and finally a Duck, and display its classes as output.

In order to have such a model, we must Train our model with Supervised Learning methods. For this type of training, our Dataset must include samples and their targets. It means that every instance of the classes it belongs to should be specified. The more the number of data set samples, the better the intelligent model will perform in diagnosis. In the continuation of this path, we have to search and find suitable data sets for this task. We may have to make data sets ourselves.
