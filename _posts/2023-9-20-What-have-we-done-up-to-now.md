title: What have we done up to now?
---

Until today, we have passed the most difficult step, the beginning. Now we are moving forward with the plans we made before. Accordingly, we needed a series of tools, including a blog, task management, social pages, GitHub, and functional scripts, which we will discuss further.

* Blog
* Task Management
* Social Pages
* GitHub
* Functional Scripts


## Blog

In order to be able to present the content in an organized manner, we needed a blog. At first, we wanted to implement it in the Flask Python framework, the start was good, but we realized that it would take a lot of time and actually keep us away from the main project. Therefore, with the consultation we had with the group members, it was decided to use a project that we had already designed (and of course it was in a different programming language) and use it as the CMS of our blog with a few changes. For a better index and to go global, we decided to present the biolingual contents.

 

## Task Management

As you must have guessed from its name, there is a project that takes a picture from you and tells what it is. Of course, we have bigger thoughts and ideas  about it (that we will share with you). Unfortunately, we have not seen anything like this. We cannot name the foreign sample with certainty because there are always sources that we do not have access to. But it is something beyond Cfar-100 and so on.One of the essential tools for devoting tasks among team members, scheduling and managing them is the use of these type of tools, and we decided to use Taskulu for ir. At first, we created two projects called Content production and Website technical development, and we wrote and scheduled the tasks based on the group's abilities, time, knowledge and of course the priority of the tasks, everyone moved one from ToDo list to Doing and after completion transfer it to Done.

 

## Social Pages

Due to making good communication, we must publish our content on Social pages and share it with a larger communities. We prioritized LinkedIn. Next, we expanded the work on Instagram and Telegram. In order to maintain the importance of the blog, we have published a summary of the contents on these pages and provided links to the full contents for further reading.

 

## GitHub

One of the best places that can be used to manage versions is Git. The first thing we did as soon as we created an account was to form an organization. With this, we could consider ourselves a member of an organization. Since the blogs in Git are very popular, after the fork of the relevant repository, we will share the English content in it as well.

 

## Functional Scripts

One of our goals (as we said from the beginning) is to share the codes we write. Therefore, we put a section in the blog (left side) with this name to publish the codes used there as mini scripts.
