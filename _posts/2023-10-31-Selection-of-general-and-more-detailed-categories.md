title: Selection of general and more detailed categories
---

So far, we have been able to advance the work of collecting images for training. While working, we should be aware of choosing general categories. With the reviews we had, we came to the conclusion to choose the categories from general to detailed. So far, we have reached 6 general categories that we are gradually completing. We will try not to increase their number to more than 10 categories and instead of adding to the general categories, we will convert them into parent categories

#Living beings
The first category that comes to our mind (and it usually comes to everyone's mind) is living organisms. We got some help from memories of science lessons and also researched some. In general, I would like to say that humans, animals, insects and plants are the main sub-categories of this category, each of which includes many sub-categories that we want to gradually complete. In my opinion, it is necessary to mention a few points here.
* We are waiting for friends' comments to help us provide better and more reasonable categories. Please write to us in the comments.
* We used handwritten text to place the images in the article. We could type, but I think it is more intimate and effective.
* It is possible to change these categories in the future, and the presence of repeated sub-categories is inevitable in some cases.

## Tools
The second category that we all deal with in today's world are tools that are used for cutting or sawing, welding or connecting two or more things together, pliers that are used to hold and hold other tools, hammers, screwdrivers, which are generally used to tighten and loosen parts, and finally, smaller tools are used.

## Transportation
The need to move from one point to another has always led to new discoveries in this direction, so naturally we chose these devices as another general category. As you can see below and in the picture below, in our opinion, transportation equipment is divided into three categories: land, air, and sea.

## Electronical equipment
I don't think there is anyone in today's world who has not dealt with or seen them. It seems that computers should be separated from laptops due to the difference in their appearance. Phones and tablets can be placed in the same group because they do not differ much in appearance. Why am I saying that in terms of appearance? Because our identification (for now) will be based on external features. We put ATM, POS and such devices in one category and finally we chose smaller electronic parts as the final sub-category of this category.

## Household and office appliances
These are the things that we constantly see in our surroundings. Whether in our own home, friends and acquaintances or in the office. Appliances that are used for washing, cooking, lighting, or related to electricity, and finally for entertainment and some kind of work related.

## Accommodation
Currently (the article may be updated later), the last general category that we could choose is accommodation, which was divided into three general sub-categories: residential, commercial, and garden or villa, which, as you can see in the picture, are currently compared to The rest of the categories mentioned so far need more details.

The last point is that we still need your help to improve this selection.
