title: What should we know?! 
---

When we consider performance, it is skill that speaks louder. We must have some special skills to be able to carry out the real work. I plan to list the things that we need to know to move this idea and project forward. Maybe my list is incomplete at the beginning, but I will try to complete it little by little.

## Suitable data scrap library
Since we are going to collect the data set ourselves, we need to know how to work with one of the common Scrap libraries. Currently, Beautifull Soap is the most serious option I know. It is very easy to install and easy to work with.

## Machine learning framework
In order not to have to implement all the requirements of a machine learning or deep learning model ourselves, logic dictates that we use a machine learning framework. Among the available options, our choice is pytorch.

In addition to these two basic and main items that were mentioned, it is necessary to have worked with Numpy, Pandas and scikit-learn. I think this is all that is needed for an initial start. We focus on these and move the project forward with them. Whenever it is necessary to add a new item to the list of abilities, I will update this post and the list.
