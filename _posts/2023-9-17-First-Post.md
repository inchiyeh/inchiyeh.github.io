I think we all agree that starting anything is the hardest part of it. Why? Because it has its own difficulties. You don't even know where to start. Sometimes you don't even know if you should start or not. After about three or four years of thinking and many discussions, we finally decided to start...

Good!

And the list of contents that you read in this post:

## The birth of an idea

The idea of ​​this thing goes back to a few months ago when we were looking to do a deep learning project with a new idea. We were working on image classifiers and even design a project to generate shapes (which is available on our git). The result of our train was not very good, accuracy of it was about 70%. By applying Torch Vision Pretrained models method we could increase the result up to 85%, but the technique was not satisfied us. So we have got an idea which will  bed discussed by details of the it in future posts, but for now we're going to give you the general idea as list below:

 

## What is this

As you must have guessed from its name, there is a project that takes a picture from you and tells what it is. Of course, we have bigger thoughts and ideas  about it (that we will share with you). Unfortunately, we have not seen anything like this. We cannot name the foreign sample with certainty because there are always sources that we do not have access to. But it is something beyond Cfar-100 and so on.

 

## Is it suit with me?

In our opinion, this blog can be useful for everyone, especially those who work in the field of Programming, Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning. But those who are thinking same as us means Did not know where to start and What to do then, can benefit the most from its contents.

 

## Casualness and Useful

Unlike many blogs which content becomes boring to read (maybe because they write very formulaic), we like to write very زasualness and useful for the reader. We are committed to providing something useful and not wasting our readers' time, which might be a light for them.

 

## How can you contact us?

* We think that the fastest way can be the comments of any post (of course, if it is related to the topic).
* If you want something that was not included in the post, you can email us at inchiyeh.ir@gmail.com
* You can follow our social pages on the left side of the blog.
* In short, as you like

 

## The path ahead

As we explained, the path ahead of us is clear. Gradually, as we  will share whatever was worked together, expressed the problems and benefited from the opinions of expert friends (you, dear readers), we will add friends who are willing to cooperate.
