Choosing a programming language that can meet the needs of ideas and projects is a sensitive and relatively difficult task. The variety of programming languages with many features that each language offers also makes this choice more difficult. We have to choose a language that is as much as possible higher than other languages.

We try to choose the right language based on its function, not just the language we know. Maybe this way we will learn a new programming language and this challenge will add another programming language to our skills. The short list we have is Python, C++, Go and Java. After checking items such as the speed and simplicity of coding, Python came up from this list and we decided to develop our idea using Python. Python language, as its developer said, is trying to make coding easier. Currently, Python language is widely used in most fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning. Python is still the best option for doing large and complex projects and it can well meet the needs of developers. Because Python is open source and has many libraries for different sectors from data mining to speech processing and natural language processing, it is of interest to experts in these fields.
