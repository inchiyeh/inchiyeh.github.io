title: How is Onchiyeh going to work?
---

You get the idea from the name. You are going to send a picture of anything that you could not identify and understand what it is so that Inchiyeh will tell you what it is. So far, the general and hidden idea behind Inchie.ir has been revealed. From a technical point of view, it can be said that we are developing a model for image classification. We will develop and train a model that can classify the image sent by the users into different classes.

Maybe it happened to you too, that you found or saw something that you don't know what it is. Our idea is to solve this challenge for you. That is, if you could not identify what your friend received or found, get help from Inchie.ir. We are trying to develop an image classification system, which will classify the submitted images to an acceptable level. For this, we will use intelligent models in the field of Machine Learning, Machine Vision and Deep Learning. Naturally, the number of classes will be very large. So we have to think about the number of classes or even hierarchical classification in the first step. In addition, one of the most fundamental challenges ahead is collecting data sets for the latest model. In the following, along the way, we will write to you about the ways we can solve these challenges.
